# Site deployment with GitHub Sites

In this activity, I had to create a functional website that extracted information about a clinical analysis of certain bacteria types that were present in seelcted individuals.
The activity involved data identification from a JSON format file and deploy it into the website in at least one table and two graphs.

The first graph shows the top ten bacteria in the selected individual, while the second one shows the quantity of them with a scatter plot.

All of this has been deployed into GitHub Sites and can be viewed directly in the browser.
